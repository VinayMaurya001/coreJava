Anonymous inner classes vs Lambda Expressions
Wherever we are using anonymous inner classes there may be a chance of using Lambda expression
to reduce length of the code and to resolve complexity.
Ex2:
class ThreadDemo {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 	Runnable runnable = () -> {
 		for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
 			System.out.println("Child Thread");
 		}
 	};
 	Thread t = new Thread(runnable);
 	t.start();
 	for(i=0; i<10; i++) {
 		System.out.println("Main Thread");
 	}
 }
}

or 
Ex2:
class ThreadDemo {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 	Thread t = new Thread(
 	() -> {
 		for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
 			System.out.println("Child Thread");
 		}
 	});
 	t.start();
 	for(i=0; i<10; i++) {
 		System.out.println("Main Thread");
 	}
 }
}

Anonymous inner class! = Lambda Expression
Anonymous inner class can extend concrete class, can extend abstract class, can implement interface with any number of methods. 
	but Lambda expression can implement an interface with only single abstract method (Functional Interface).
Hence if anonymous inner class implements Functional Interface in that particular case only we can replace with lambda expressions. 
	Hence wherever anonymous inner class concept is there, it may not always possible to replace with Lambda expressions.
If anonymous inner class implementing functional interface or containing only one method, 
	then we may use Lambda expression in place of anonymous inner class.



Inside anonymous inner class we can declare instance variables.
	Inside lambda expression we cann't declare instance variables.
	Whatever the variables declare inside lambda expression(because it is a anonymous function) are simply acts as local variables.

Inside anonymous inner class "this" always refers current inner class object(anonymous inner class) 
but not related outer class object. 
	Within lambda expression "this" keyword represents current outer class object reference 
	(that is current enclosing class reference in which we declare lambda expression)
Example:
interface Interf {
	public void m1();
}
class Test {
	int x = 777;
	public void m2() {
		Interf i = ()-> {
 		int x = 888;
 		System.out.println(x); 888
 		System.out.println(this.x); 777
 		};
 	i.m1();
 	}
 	public static void main(String[] args) {
 		Test t = new Test();
 		t.m2();
 	}
}

From lambda expression we can access enclosing class variables and enclosing method variables directly.

The local variables referenced from lambda expression are implicitly final.
and hence we cann't perform re-assignment for those local variables otherwise we get compile time error
interface Interf {
	public void m1();
}
class Test {
	int x = 10;
	public void m2() {
		int y = 20;
 		Interf i = () -> {
 			int z=30;
 			z=z+1;//NO CTE
 			System.out.println(x); 10
 			System.out.println(y); 20
 			x = 888;
 			//y = 999; //CTE
 		};
 		i.m1();
 		y = 777;
	}
 	public static void main(String[] args) {
 		Test t = new Test();
 		t.m2(); 
	}
}


Differences between anonymous inner classes and Lambda expression
1)It's a class without name 
	It's a method without name (anonymous function)
2)Anonymous inner class can extend Abstract and concrete classes
	Lambda expression cann't extend Abstract and concrete classes
3)Anonymous inner class can implement an interface that contains any number of Abstract methods
	Lambda expression can implement an Interface which contains single abstract method (Functional Interface)
4) Inside anonymous inner class we can Declare instance variables.
   Inside lambda expression we cann't Declare instance variables, 
   whatever the variables declared are simply acts as local variables.
5) Anonymous inner classes can be Instantiated
	Lambda expressions cann't be instantiated
6)Inside anonymous inner class "this" always refers current anonymous Inner class object but not outer class Object.
	Inside lambda expression "this" always refers current outer class object. That is enclosing class object.
7)Anonymous inner class is the best choice If we want to handle multiple methods.
	Lambda expression is the best Choice if we want to handle interface With single abstract method (Functional Interface).
8)In the case of anonymous inner class at the time of compilation a separate Dot class file will be generated(outerclass$1.class)
	At the time of compilation no dot Class file will be generated for Lambda expression. 
	It simply converts into private method of outer class.?

9)Memory allocated on demand,Whenever we are creating an object.
	Reside in permanent memory of JVM (Method Area).
	
	
Don’t Treat Lambda Expressions as Inner Classes
Two concepts are different in an important way: scope
When you use an inner class, it creates a new scope. 
	You can hide local variables from the enclosing scope by instantiating new local variables with the same names. 
	You can also use the keyword this inside your inner class as a reference to its instance.
However, lambda expressions work with enclosing scope. 
	You can’t hide variables from the enclosing scope inside the lambda’s body. 
	In this case, the keyword this is a reference to an enclosing instance.
