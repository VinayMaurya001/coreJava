AssertionError
AssertionError is the child class of Error. Hence it is unchecked exception.

If assert statements fails( that is argument evaluated to false) then we will get assertion error.

Class Test
{
Psvm()
{
	Int x=10;
	Try
	{
		Assert(c>10);
	}
	Catch(AssertionErro e)
{	
	SOP(“I am stupid because I am catching assertion error”);
}
	SOP(x);
}
}
It is legal to catch AssertionError but it is not a good programming practice.

In the case of web based applications, if we run java program in debug mode, automatically assert statements will be executed.
