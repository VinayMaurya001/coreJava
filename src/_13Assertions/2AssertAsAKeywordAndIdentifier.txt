Assert as a keyword & identifier
Assert keyword introduced in java 1.4v, onwards we cann’t use assert as identifier since 1.4v. Otherwise we will get CTE.

int x=10;
int if=20;//CTE
int assert =10;//CTE,for Java 1.4v onwards

Notes
If we are using assert as identifier & if we are trying to compile according to old version(Java 1.3v or lower), 
	then code compiles fine but with warnings.
We can compile a java program, according to a particular version by using –source option.
Javac –source 1.3 Test.java  //compile fine but with warning
Java Test


Class One
{
PSVM()
{
int assert=10;
SOP(assert);// using assert as a identifier
}
}

Class Two
{
PSVM()
{
int x=10;
assert(x>10);//using assert as a keyword
}
}

Javac  -source 1.3 One.java //Compiles fine but with warning
Javac  -source 1.4 One.java//CTE
Javac  -source 1.3 Two.java//CTE
Javac  -source 1.4 Two.java// Compiles fine without warning
