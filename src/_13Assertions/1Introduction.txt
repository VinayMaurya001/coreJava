Introduction:
Very common way of debugging is uses of SOP() statements. 
	But the problem with SOP() is, after fixing the bug, compulsory we have to delete SOP() statements. 
	Otherwise these SOP()s will be executed at runtime, for every request, which creates performance problem & disturb server logs.
To overcome this problem, SUN people introduce assertion concept in Java 1.4V.

Objective of assertions:
	To perform debugging.
	
Advantage of assertions:
The  main advantage of assertions, when compared with SOPs is after fixing the bug, we are not required to remove assert statement, 
	because they wonn’t be executed by default at runtime.
Based on our reuirement, we can enable & disable assertions. By default assertions are disable.



A project have many applications usually.
For every project, there will be 3 environment:
	Development(for small it not may not exist)
	Test
	Production

Developer does not have access to production end.
Usually we can perform debugging in development and test environment, but not in production environment. 
Hence assertions concept applicable for development & test environment but not for production.
