Appropriate & in-appropriate use of Assertions
Assertions are just for debugging purpose.
Assertion statements not executes by default on client machine.

Example:
Check of 1 rupee after sitting 1 hr in ac nd drinking 4 glass water- if cashier have gun then shoot
Case 1
It is always in-appropriate to mix programming logic with assert statements 
	because there is no guarantee for the execution of assert statements always at runtime.

public void withdraw(double amount)
{
	if(amount>100)
	{
		Process request
    }else{
       throw new IllegalStateException()
    }
}
Public void withdraw(double amount)
{
    Assert(amount>100);//in-appropriate use of assert
	Process request;
}



Case 2
While performing debugging in our program, if there is any place where the control is not allowed to reach. 
That is the best place to use assertion.
Switch(monthNumber)
{
Case 1:  SOP(“JAN”);break;
Case 2:  SOP(“FEB”);break;
.
.
.
Case 12:  SOP(“DEC”);break;
Default:
	assert(false);//AssertionError
}



Case 3:
It is always inappropriate for validating public method  arguments by using assertion 
because outside person does not aware whether assertions are enable or disable in our system.
public void m1(int x)
{
	assert(x>10);
}


Case 4:
It is always appropriate for validating private method  arguments by using assertion 
because local person aware whether assertions are enable or disable in our system.
private void m1(int x)
{
	assert(x>10);
}

Case 5:
It is always inappropriate for validating command line arguments by using assertions 
because these are arguments to main() method, which is public.
PSVM(String[] args)
{
	assert(args[0].equals(“sachin”));
}

Class Test
{
int y=5;
public void m1(int x)
{
	assert(x>10);//1, inappropriate
	switch(x)
	{
		Case 10:SOP(10);break;
		Case 11:SOP(11);break;
		default:	assert(false);//2, appropriate
}
}
private void m2(int x)
{
	Assert(x<10);//3, appropriate
}
private void m3(int x)
{
   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
	assert(m4());//4, inappropriate, programmic logic mixed with assert statement
	;;;;;;;;;;;;;
}
private boolean m4(int x)
{
	Y=6;
	Return true;
}
}
