Random Number
	java.util.Random class
	java.lang.Math.random() method 
	java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom class(since Java 1.7)


Translating and Scaling Random Numbers
Suppose you are writing a game program that simulates rolling dice, and so need a random integer in the range 1 to 6. 
	"nextInt" can give you one in the range 0 to 5, and you can translate this to the range you need:
   	int roll = generator.nextInt(6) + 1;
In drawing a pattern made up of random lines, you want to pick a random angle between 0 and 360 degrees at which to draw a line. 
	The angle can be any real number. The "nextDouble" message will give you a random real number, 
	but between 0 and 1. You can use scaling to turn this into a real number between 0 and 360:
  	 double angle = generator.nextDouble() * 360.0;
Suppose the same pattern-drawing program also needs to pick random lengths for the lines, 
	but that the lines should never be shorter than 10 units, nor longer than 50. 
	Line lengths can be any real number between these limits. 
	Thus you need random lengths from a 40-unit range starting at 10. 
	You can use scaling and translation together to generate these numbers from "nextDouble":
   	double length = generator.nextDouble() * 40.0 + 10.0;
	//rand.nextInt((max - min) + 1) + min;

1 to 50
	double random1 = Math.random() * 49 + 1;
	int random2 = (int) (Math.random() * 50 + 1);
