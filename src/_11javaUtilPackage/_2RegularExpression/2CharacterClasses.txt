Character classes(Groups)
Construct		Description
[abc]			Either a, b, or c (simple class)
[^abc]			Any character except a, b, or c (negation)
[a-z]			Any lower case alphabet symbol from a to z
[A-Z]			Any upper case alphabet symbol from A to Z
[a-zA-Z]		a through z, or A through Z, inclusive (range)
[0-9]			Any digit from 0 to 9
[0-9a-zA-Z]		Any alphanumeric character
[^0-9a-zA-Z]	Except alphanumeric character(special symbols)
[a-d[m-p]]		a through d, or m through p: [a-dm-p] (union)
[a-z&&[def]]	d, e, or f (intersection)
[a-z&&[^bc]]	a through z, except for b and c: [ad-z] (subtraction)
[a-z&&[^m-p]]	a through z, and not m through p: [a-lq-z] (subtraction)


Predefined character classes(Groups)
\s  space characters
\S  except space any character
\d any digit from 0-9
\D except digit any character
\w any word character (any alphanumeric character)
\W special character
.  any character


Quantifiers
We can use quantifiers to specify number of occurancs to match.
a? --> at-most a
a --> exactly one a
a* --> any number of a’s including zero number
a+ --> at-least one a


Pattern p=Pattern.compile(“X”);
Matcher m=p.Matcher(“a3b#k@9z”);
while (m.find()) {
	System.out.println(m.group() + "\t" + m.start() + "\t" + m.end());
}
