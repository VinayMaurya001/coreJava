How Memory Works: The stack and the heap
	Each thread run in separate own stack.
	Each block variable destroyed from the stack when block ends.
Passing Objects b/w Methods
	Passing By Value means
	Passing by Reference means
	Passing Object into methods
	The final keyword & why it is not same as constant
	Why the final keyword doesn't stop an object's value from being changed

In Java, there is nothing like Passed by reference.	
For objects passed into methods, the REFERENCE to the objet is passed by value.


Final variable can not be reassigned.
Final variable, method & class  can be  potentially optimized by compiler. But it is not necessary.

const correctness is not provided in Java.
Final Customer customer=new customer("Sachin");
customer.getName();
So follwoing issue may come in java, even customer is a final variable. 
String getName(){
return name+"XXXX";
}
