What is a soft leak?
	The Java Virtual Machine will automatically release all of its allocated memory 
		back to the operating system when the application finishes.
	This means that a traditional leak is not possible at least assuming that 
		the Java Virtual Machine is correctly implemented.
	But some leaks are possible and I'm going to refer to these as soft leaks.
