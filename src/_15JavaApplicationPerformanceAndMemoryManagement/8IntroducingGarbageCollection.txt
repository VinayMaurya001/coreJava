What is means when we say Java is a managed language
	Memory leaks should not be possible in Java.
		VM is written in c language,which manage memory with the help of OS.
	Garbage collection is the process to free up memory.
		Garbage collection introduced in LISP Programming language in 1959.
	

How Java knows which objects can be removed from the Heap
	Any object on the heap which can not be reached through a reference from 
	the stack or Meta-space(where static object reference is present) is eligible for garbage collection.
	
	
The System.gc() method
	GarbageCollectionMain.java m1()

Java 11's garbage collector can give unused memory back to the operation system
	
Why it is not a good idea to run the System.gc() method
	Garbage collector uses system resources
	
The finalize() method
	From Java 9 finalize() method depricated.
	
The danger of using finalize()
	If finalize() method contain infinite loop then it may kind of stop the garbage collection process.
