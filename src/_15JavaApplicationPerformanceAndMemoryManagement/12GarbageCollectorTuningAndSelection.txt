Turning off automated heap allocation sizing

Turning garbage collection-old & young allocation
	-XX:NewRatio=n(old/young generation, minum value is 1)

Turning garbage collection-generations needed to become old

Selecting a garbage collector
Type of Collector
	Serial
		Uses single thread to perform all of the garbage collection work, 
		-XX:+UseSerialGC
		better to use for background application
	Parllel
		Better performace than Serial GC
		-XX:+UseParallelGC
	Mostly Concucrrent
		Pause the application for marking only but not during sweeping
		-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
		-XX:+UseG1GC

The G1garbage collector(Garbage first collector
	Normally G1 is beeter than ConcMarkSweepGC
	Heap devided into regions

Turning the GI garbage collector
	-XX:ConcGCThreads=n
	-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=n



String de-duplication(Since Java 8.20)
	-XX:UseStringDeDuplication(Only available if using GI )
