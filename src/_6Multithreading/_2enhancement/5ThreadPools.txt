Thread Pools Framework (Executors Framework)
Thread Pools 
Creating a new thread for every job, may create performance & memory utilization problem. 
	To overcome this we should go for thread pool.
Thread pool is a pool of already created threads ready to do our job.
Java 1.5v introduces thread pool framework to implement thread pools.
Thread pool framework also known as executor framework.

We can create a thread pool as follows:
ExecutorService service =Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

We can submit a runnable job by using submit() method:
service.submit(myThreadJob);

We can shutdown executors service by using shutdown() method.
service.shutdown();

Example: ThreadPoolDemo.java(m1())
Here Single thread can be used for multiple jobs.
While developing web servers & application servers, we can use ThreadPool concepts.
Default ThreadPool size for most web server is 60.
