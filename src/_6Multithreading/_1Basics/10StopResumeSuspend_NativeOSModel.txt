How to stop a thread
Killing a person in middle of life is not recommended. 

We can stop a thread execution by using stop() method of thread class.
public void stop()
If we call stop() method then immediately the thread will enter into dead states. 
Anyway stop() method is deprecated & not recommended to use.

run()
{
		Open db connection			//t.start()
		Read data				//t.stop()
		Close db connection// will not execute
}
 

class Test
{
	public static void main(String [] args)
	{
		MyThread t=new MyThread();
		t.start();
		System.out.println("End of main thread");
		t.stop();//line 1
}}
class MyThread extends Thread
{
	public void run()
	{
		for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
		{
			System.out.println("Child Thread");
			try
			{
				Thread.sleep(2000);
			}
			catch(InterruptedException e)
			{

			}
		}
	}
}
After compilation:
Note: C:\Users\Java\Documents\Test.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.

How to suspend(temporarily paused) & resume a thread

We can resume a suspended thread by using resume() method of Thread class. Then suspended can continue its execution.


public void suspend()
public void resume()
Anyway these methods are deprecated & not recommended to use.


Green Thread
There in no concept of pink thread. ☺ 

Java multi-threading concept is implemented by using two model:
⦁	Green Thread model
⦁	Native OS model

Green Thread model
The thread which is managed completely by JVM without taking underlying OS support, is called green thread model.
Very few OS like SUN solaries provide support for  green thread model.
Anyway green thread model is deprecated & not recommended to use.

Native OS model
The thread which is managed by JVM with the help of underlying OS , is called native OS  model.
All window based OS provides support for native OS model.
