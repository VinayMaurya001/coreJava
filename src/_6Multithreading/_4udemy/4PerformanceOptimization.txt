Introduction to performance & Optimizing for latency
Performance Criteria/definition
	Uses cases
		High Speed Trading System
			Latency measured in unit of time
		Video Player
			TO show the content to user at correct & precise frame rate with minimum jitter
			Precision & accuracy of frame rate
		Machine Learning
			Throughput, Here latency & lack of  jitter not that important
	Latency
		The time to completion of a task, measured in time units
	Throughput	
		The amount of tasks completed in a given period. Measured in task /time unit.
	Latency & throughput are completely independent. Improve one may or may not have impact on other.
	
	
Latency
Theoretical reduction of latency by N=performance improvement by a facotr of N
N=?:How many subtasks/threads to break the original task?
	On a general purpose computer, N= no of cores
	#threads=#cores is optimal only if all threads are runnable and can run without interruption(no I/O blocking calls/sleep etc)
	The assumption is nothing else is running that consumes a lot of CPU.
	Hyperthreading-Virtual Cores vs Physical COres

Does breaking original tasks & aggregating result come for free?
	Inherent cost of paralllelization & Aggregation
		Breaking task into multiple tasks
		Thread creation , passing taks to threads
		Time b/w thread.start() to thread getting scheduled
		Time until the last thread finishes & signals
		Time until the aggragating thread runs
		Aggregation of the subresults into a single artifact.
	We should not break into subtaks which are very small.	
Can we break any task into subtasks?No
	1)Parallelizable tasks
	2)Unbreakable, sequential tasks
	3)Partially Parallelizablem partially sequential
	
	
Summary
Performance can be divided in many ways depending upon the use case
Multithreaded Application Performance Criteria
	Latency
	THroughput

Optimizing for latency 2-Image Processing
	Image Processing Sequential
		ARGB-A for Alpha(transparency)
		ImageProcessing.java
	Performance/Latency measurement
	Image processing-Multithreaded
	
Optimizing for throughput part 1
Throuput definition
	The amount of tasks completed in a given period. Measured in task /time unit.
2 approaches to throughput improvement
	1)Breaking tasks into subtaks
		throughput<=N/T
		latency>=T/N	
		Inherent cost of paralllelization & Aggregation
	2)Running tasks in Parallel
		throughput<=N/T
		latency=T	
		Inherent cost of paralllelization & Aggregation is very minimum.
Thread Pooling
	Create thread , Start thread 
	Also provide queue to store them


Optimizing for throughput part 2- HttpServer+Jmeter
	Http Server
		ThroughputHttpServer.java
		http://127.0.0.1:8000/search?word=talk
	Measure throughput using Apache Jmeter
	Performance Measurement & Analysis
	
 Apache Jmeter 
 	Java Performance Automation Tool
 	Do not require writing any code
 	Tool is out of scope for our course
