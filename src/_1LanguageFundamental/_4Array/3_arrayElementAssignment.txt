Array element assignment
Case 1:
In the case of primitive type arrays as array elements, we can provide any type which can be implicitly promoted to declared type.
	int[] x=new int[5];
	x[0]=5;
	x[1]=’a’;
	byte b=10;
	x[2]=b;
	short s=20;
	x[3]=s;
	x[4]=50L;//CTE
In the case of float type arrays the allowed data types are byte, short, char, int, long and float.

Case 2:
Object[] a=new Object[10];
a[0]=new Object();
a[1]=new String(“Rahul”);
a[2]=new Integer();

Number[] n=new Number[10];
n[0]=new Integer(10);
n[1]=new String(“Rahul”);//CTE, 
In the case of object type arrays, as array element we can provide either declared type object or its child class object.

Case 3:
For interface type array, as array elements its implementation class objects are allowed.
Runnable[] r=new Runnable[10];
r[0]=new Thread();
r[1]=new String(“Rahul”);//CTE

Array type 					Allowed element type
Primitive arrays			Any type which can be implicitly promoted to declared type
Object type arrays			Either declared type or its child class object
Abstract class type arrays  Its child class object
Interface type arrays 		Its implementation class object
