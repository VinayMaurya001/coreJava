Array

Introduction
An array is an 
	indexed based collection of 
	fixed number of
	homogeneous element,
	stored at contiguous memory location
	referred by a single name

The main advantage of array is we can represent huge number of values by using single variable so that readability of the code will be improved.
Using single name, we can refer many values.

But the main disadvantage of array is fixed in size. 
That is once we create an array, there is no chance of increasing or decreasing size based on our requirement. 
Hence to use array concept compulsory we should know the size in advance, which may not possible always.
int [] x=new int[1000];

int a=3,b=5,c=1,d=11,e=9;
int max=a;
if(max<b)	max=b;
If(max<c)	max=c;
If(max<d)	max=d;
If(max<e)	max=e;

int[] arr=new int[5];
For(i=0;i<=arr.length;i++){
	if(max<arr[i]){
		max=arr[i];
	}
}

Sorting of values
	Without array using variable
	With array

System.out.println(Arrays.asList(sortedArray));
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sortedArray));
