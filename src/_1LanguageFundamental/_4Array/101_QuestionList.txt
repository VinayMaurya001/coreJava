1) What is diff b/w length and length()?

length:
int[] x=new int[6];
SOP(x.length());//CTE, cannot find symbol….
SOP(x.length);
Length is a final variable, applicable for arrays. Length variable represents the size of an array.

Length()
String s="rahul";
SOP(s.length);//CTE, cannot find symbol…..
SOP(s.length());
Length() method is a final method, applicable for String object.length() method returns, number of characters, present in the string.
Length variable applicable for arrays but not for String object. Where as  length() method is applicable for String objects but not for arrays.

String s={“s”,”ss”,”sss”};
SOP(s.length);//3
SOP(s.length());//CTE, cannot find symbol…….
SOP(s[0].length);//CTE, cannot find symbol…….
SOP(s[0].length());//1

int [][] x=new int[6][3];
SOP(x.length);//6
SOP(x[0].length);//3
SOP(x[1].length);//3
In multidimensional array, length variable represents only base size but not total size.
There is no direct way to find total length of multidimensional array but indirectly we can find.
