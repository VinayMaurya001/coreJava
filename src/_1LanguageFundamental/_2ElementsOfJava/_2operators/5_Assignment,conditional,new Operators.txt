Assignment operator
	Simple assignment, int x=10;
	chained assignment, a=b=c=20;
	Compound assignment operator, a+=20;

Chained assignment
int a,b,c,d
a=b=c=d=20;
SOP(a+”…”+b+”…”+c+”…”+d);//20…20…20…20

int a=b=c=d=20;//CTE, cannot find symbol
We cannot perform chained assignment directly at the time of declaration. 

int b,c,d;
int a=b=c=d=20;

Compound assignment operator (+=, -=, *=, /=,  %=,    &=, |=, ^=,     >>=, >>>=, <<=)
Sometimes assignment operator mixed with some other operator, such type of assignment operators are called compound assignment operator.

int a=10;
a+=20;
SOP(a);//30


The following are all possible compound assignment operator in java:
+=,	=,	*=,	/=,	%=,    
&=,	|=,	^=,     
>>=,	>>>=,	<<=



byte b=10;
b=b+1;//max(int,byte,int)=int
SOP(b);//CTE,possible loss of precision

byte b=10;
b++;//b=(byte)(b+1);
SOP(b);//11

byte b=10;
b+=1;//b=(byte)(b+1);
SOP(b);//11

byte b=127;
b+=3;
SOP(b);//-126
In the case of compound assignment operator, internal type casting will be performed automatically.
Int a,b,c,d;
a=b=c=d=20;
a+= b-=   c*=  d/=2;
SOP(a+”…”+b+”…”+c+”…”+d);//-160…-180…200…10


Conditional operator(?:)
The only possible ternary operator in Java is conditional operator.

int x=10<20?30:40;
SOP(x);//30

int x=(10>20)?30:((40>50)?60:70);
SOP(x);//70
we can perform nesting of conditional operator also.
In olden days we discuss several loopholes related to conditional operator 
	but now it is not required neither for SCJP purpose nor for day to day programming.


new operator
We can use new operator to create object.
Test t=new Test();
After creating an object constructor will be executed to perform initialization of an object.
       Hence constructor is not for creation of an object. And it is for initialization of an object.
In java, we have only new keyword but not delete keyword. Because destruction of useless objects is the responsibility of garbage collector.


[] operator (square bracket open & close operator)
We can use this operator to declare and create arrays.
int[] x=new int[10];//reading,  new int array of 10.
