In any programming language, usually highest precedence goes to unary operator and then binary operator and last ternary operator.
	Unary operator
		++
		--
		
	Binary operator
		==, !=
		<, >
		>=, <=
		||
		+, -, *, /

	Ternary operator
		?if true:if false

In any programming language, usually least precedence goes to assignment operator.
a=b+c*d/2+3;

Evaluation order of java operands
class Test{
PSVM(){
	SOP( m1(1)+m1(2)*m1(3)/m1(4)+m1(5)*m1(6) );
}
static int m1(int i){
	SOP(i);
	return i;
}
}
Output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
32

In Java, we have only operator precedence but there is no precedence for operands. 
Before applying any operator, all operands will be evaluated form left to right.
1+2*3/4+5*6
1+6/4+5*6
1+1+5*6
1+1+30
2+30
32
