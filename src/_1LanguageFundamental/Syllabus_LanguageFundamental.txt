Identifier
A name in Java program is considered as identifier, which can be used for identification purpose.
It can be, Method name, Variable name, Class name/interface name, Label name.

Data Type
	Non- Primitive/Reference Type
	Primitive data type(8)
		Numeric data type
			Integral type
			 byte 
			 short 
			 int
			 long
			Floating point type
			 float 
			 double
		Non-numeric data type
		 char  
		 boolean
		 
Literals/Constant
A constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called literal.
Integral literal : For integral data type(byte, short, int, long)
	int  literals
		Decimal literals
		Octal literals
		Hexadecimal literals
		Binary literals
	long literals
		Decimal literals with suffix l/L

Octal literals with suffix 0
Hexadecimal literals with suffix 0x/0X
Binary literals with suffix 0b/0B

	Floating point literals
		float literals with suffix f/F
	double literals
		with or without suffix d/D
Exponential form/scientific notation
	Example: 
	 double d=1.2e3;//1.2*10^3,1200.0
Boolean Literals
	true
	false
String literals: “”
Null literal : null keyword
char Literals
	Within single quotes i.e. ‘a’
As integral literal which represents uni-code value of the character  (0 to 65535)
Decimal literals
Octal literals
Hexadecimal literals
Binary literals
In Unicode representation i.e.  ‘\uxxxx’
8 escape characters
Uses of underscore symbol in numeric literals


Variable
Variable is the name of memory allocation.

Types of Variables
Division 1: Based on type of value represented by a variable
			 Primitive Variable:
							int x=10;
			 Reference Variable:
							Student s=new Student();
Division 2: Based on position of declaration & behavior of variable
			 Instance variable /object level variable /attribute /fields
			 Static variable /class level variables /attribute /fields 
			 Local variable/ temporary variable /stack variable /automatic variable/ thread safe variable
Type of variable    Thread safe 		Life		            	 		Scope
Instance variable   No              same as object                         according to public/protected/<default>/private
Static variable	    No              same as .class file                   according to public/protected/<default>/private
Local variable	    Yes	            same as block execution inside block

main() method
	For main() method, inheritance & overloading concepts are applicable but overriding concept is not applicable. 
	Instead of overriding, method hiding is applicable.
Q:Without writing main() method, is it possible to print some statements to the console?
Ans:Yes, by static block till 1.6 v but from 1.7 v onwards it is not possible to print some statements to the console.

Java Coding Standards
Advantage:
	Readability
	Maintainability
