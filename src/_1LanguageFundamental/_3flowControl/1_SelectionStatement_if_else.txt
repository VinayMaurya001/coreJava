Flow Control
	At runtime, in which order statement will be executed, is decided by flow control.
	Flow control describes the order in which the statement will be executed at runtime.

Selection Statement
	If, else, switch, ?:
Iterative statement
	For, while, do-while, for, for each(since 1.5v)
Transfer statement or jump statement
	Break, continue, return, 
	try, catch, finally, 
	assert (since 1.4 v)
Among several options, only one statement will be selected and will be executed , is selection statement.
A group of statement will be executed iteratively, is called iterative statement.



Selection Statement
If-else
The argument to the if statement should be Boolean type. By mistake if we are trying to provide any other type then we will get CTE.
Example 1
int x=0;
if(x){ //CTE, incompatible type, found:int, required:boolean
SOP(“hello”);
}else
{SOP(“hi”);
}

Example 2
int x=10;
if(x=20){ //CTE, incompatible type, found:int, required:boolean
SOP(“hello”);
}else
{SOP(“hi”);
}

Example 3
int x=10;
if(x==20){ //NO CTE
SOP(“hello”);
}else{
SOP(“hi”);
}
Output:
	hi

Example 4
Boolean b=true;
If(b=false){
SOP(“hello”);
}else{
SOP(“hi”);
}
Output:
	Hi
	
Example 5
Boolean b=false;
If(b==false){
SOP(“hello”);
}else{
SOP(“hi”);
}
Output:
	Hello 

Example 6
If(true)
SOP(“hello”);
Output:
 hello

Example 7
Semicolon is a valid java statement.	
If(true);
Output:

Example 8
If(true);
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Output:

Example 9
If(true)
int x=10;//CTE

Example 10
If(true){
int x=10;//no CTE
}
Semicolon is an valid Java statement, which is also known as empty statement. Else part and curly braces are optional.
Without curly braces, only one statement is allowed under if, which should not be declarative statement. 
Because if would declare variable then there is no possibility to use of that variable further.

Example 11
Java compiler is very strong. Unlike other old languages, there is no dangling problem in java. 
Every else is mapped to the nearest if statement in the same block.
if(true)
	if(true)
		SOP(“hello”);
else
            SOP(“hi”);
