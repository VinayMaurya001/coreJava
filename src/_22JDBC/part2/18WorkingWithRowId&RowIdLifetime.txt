Working with RowId and RowIdLifetime

RowId interface:  
	Present in java.sql package. 
	Introduced in JDBC 4.0V. 
	For every row Database engine will associate a unique id, which is nothing but RowId. 
	Internally RowId represents logical address of the row. 
	Whenever we are inserting rows automatically Database engine will generate RowId for each row and programmer is not responsible to provide. 
	Database Engine will use RowId internally to retrieve Data. 
	The main advantage of RowId is Fast Retrieval of Data. 
 
Sample Java Code to get RowId: 
	ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("select rowid,eno,ename,esal,eaddr from employees"); 
	RowId id = rs.getRowId("rowid"); or    RowId id = rs.getRowId(1);  

RowId is an object and hence we have to convert into byte[].  
	byte[] b=id.getBytes(); 
 
We have to convert byte[] into String, so that we will get meaningful String representation 
	String s = new String(b); 
	System.out.println(b); 
 
Demo Program to Retrieve Data including RowId
	Example: RowIdDemo1.java (m1())
Demo Program to Retrieve Databased on given RowId
	Example:  RowIdDemo1.java (m2())

RowIdLifetime: 
	It is an enum present in java.sql package 
	RowIdLifetime represents the life time of generated RowIds 
	The possible values for RowIdLifetime are 
		1. ROWID_UNSUPPORTED     
			Indicates that DB won't provide support for RowIds 
		2. ROWID_VALID_FOREVER      
			Indicates that life time is forever and unlimited       
		3. ROWID_VALID_SESSION      
			Indicates that rowid applicable only for current session 

4. ROWID_VALID_TRANSACTION      
	Indicates that rowid is valid only for current Session    
Note:  For oracle database it is  ROWID_VALID_FOREVER  
	   But for MySQL database it is   ROWID_UNSUPPORTED
