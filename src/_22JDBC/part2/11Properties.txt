Properties 
In Java Program if anything which changes frequently(like jdbc url, username, pwd etc)is not recommended to hard code in our program. 
 
The problem in this approach is if there is any change in java program,to reflect that change we have to 
	recompile,rebuild and re-deploy total application and even some times server restart also required,
	which creates a big business impact to the client. 
 
To overcome this problem, we should go for Properties file. 
The variable things we have to configure in Properties file and we have to read these properties from java program. 
The main advantage of this approach is if there is any change in Properties file and to reflect that 
	change just re-deployment is enough, which won't create any business impact to the client. 
 
Program to Demonstrate use of Properties file: 
	db.properties:  
		url= jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE 
		user= system 
		pwd= myoracle
	Example: JdbcPropertiesDemo.java


If we change the properties in properties file for mysql database then the program will fetch data from mysql database. 
	db.properties: 
		url= jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/durgadb 
		user= root 
		pwd= root123 

Program to Demonstrate use of Properties file: 
	db1.properties:
		url= jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/durgadb  
		user=root 
		password=root123 
	Example: JdbcPropertiesDemo1.java: 


Q. How many getConnection() methods are available in DriverManager class. 
	1. Connection con=DM.getConnection(url,user,pwd); 
	2. Connection con=DM.getConnection(url,Properties); 
	3. Connection con=DM.getConnection(url); 
	Eg: Connection con=DM.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/durgadb?user=root&password=root123"); 
	Eg: Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:scott/tiger@localhost:1521:XE")
