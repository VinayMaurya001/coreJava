Batch Updates 
Need of Batch Updates: 
	When we submit multiple SQL Queries to the database one by one then lot of time will be wasted in request and response. 
 
In the case of simple Statement: 
	 Java Application -->Request time -->DB -->Compile time
	 Java Application <--Response time <--DB <--Execution time

	Total Time per Query = Req.T+C.T+E.T+Resp.T                                         
						 = 1 ms + 1 ms + 1 ms + 1 ms = 4ms 
			per 1000 Queries = 4 * 1000ms = 4000ms

In the case of PreparedStatement: 
	 Java Application -->Request time -->DB -->Compile time
	 Java Application <--Response time <--DB

	Total Time per Query  = Req.T+Resp.T+E.T                                         
						  = 1 ms + 1 ms + 1 ms = 3ms  
			1000 Queries = 3000ms 
	
In the above 2 cases, we are trying to submit 1000 queries to the database one by one. 
For submitting 1000 queries we need to communicate with the database 1000 times. 
It increases network traffic between Java application and database and even creates performance problems also. 
 
To overcome these problems, we should go for Batch updates. 
We can group all related SQL Queries into a single batch and we can send that batch at a time to the database. 


	Java App  <----> Query-1,Query-2,..,..,..,Query-n <----> DB
					<--------Batch of queries-------->

	With Simple Statement Batch Updates: 
	Per 1000 Queries = Req.Time+1000*C.T+1000*E.T+Resp.Time                                 
					 = 1ms+1000*1ms+1000*1ms+1ms      
					 = 2002ms                  
	With PreparedStatement Batch Updates:  
	Per 1000 Queries = Req.Time+1000*E.T+Resp.Time                                 
					 = 1ms+1000*1ms+1ms      
					 = 1002ms 
					  
Hence the main advantages of Batch updates are  
	1. We can reduce network traffic 
	2. We can improve performance. 
 
We can implement batch updates by using the following two methods  
	1. public void addBatch(String sqlQuery)     
		To add query to batch 
	2. int[] executeBatch()     
		to execute a batch of sql queries 
	We can implement batch updates either by simple Statement or by PreparedStatement 


Program to Demonstrate Batch Updates with Simple Statement 
	Example: BatchUpdates1.java

Program to Demonstrate Batch Updates with PreparedStatement
	Example: BatchUpdates2.java


Limitations of Batch updates: 
	1. We can use Batch Updates concept only for non-select queries. 
		If we are trying to use for select queries then we will get RE saying BatchUpdateException.  
	2. In batch if one sql query execution fails then remaining sql queries wont be executed. 
 
*****Q: In JDBC How Many Execute Methods Are Avaialble? 
In total there are 4 methods are available 
1. executeQuery() 
	For select queries 
2. executeUpdate() 
	For non-select queries(insert|delete|update) 
3. execute()      
	For both select and non-select queries      
	For calling Stored Procedures 
4. executeBatch()
	For Batch Updates
