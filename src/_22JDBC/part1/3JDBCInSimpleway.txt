JDBC in Simple Way 

Java application(Ameerpet)	Driver(Translator)	--> Connection(Road)	--> Database(xyz place) 
|
Statement(Vehicle)					<----------->							ResultSet(Box)

Driver (Translator): 
To convert Java specific calls into Database specific calls and Database specific calls into Java calls. 
 
Connection (Road): 
By using Connection, Java Application can communicate with Database. 
 
Statement (Vehicle): 
By using Statement Object we can send our SQL Query to the Database and we can get Results from Database. 
 
ResultSet:  
ResultSet holds Results of SQL Query. 

Steps for JDBC Application: 
 Load and Register Driver 
 Establish Connection between Java Application and Database 
 Create Statement Object 
 Send and Execute SQL Query 
 Process Results from ResultSet 
 Close Connection 
 
 
Demo Program: 
 import java.sql.*;   
 public class JdbcDemo  {       
 	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
 	    Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");  
 	    Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:odbc:demodsn","scott","tiger"); 
 	    Statement st = con.createStatement();   
 	    ResultSet rs= st.executeQuery("select * from employees");   
 	    while(rs.next())  
 	    {   
 	    	System.out.println(rs.getInt(1)+".."+rs.getString(2)+".."+rs.getDouble(3)+"..."+rs.get String(4));   
 	    }   
      	con.close();  
     }
}
