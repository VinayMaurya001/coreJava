	Signed
		Integer

			int 
			long
		Floating-point

Java is a strongly typed language.
	We must declare and define its type before we can assign a value to it or even we can use it in SOP().

A literal is a fixed value that doesn't need further calculations in order for it to be assigned to any varaible.

int i=Integer.parseInt("12_34");//No CTE, RTE

 Internally Java soters char data as an un-signed interger value (positive integer).


 char ch1='z';
 char ch1=122;// a number in base 10, prints z
 char ch1='\u0122';//a number in base 16, prints special character 

 char ch1=-123;//CTE
 char ch1=(char)-123;//No CTE

 Casting is forcefully conversion of one data type to another data type.



 For identifier, we can use currency sign-$,pound etc.


 The literal value for all types of object reference variable is null.
 When method accept reference variable as a method parameter .
 Method may change state of reference variable or assign new object to reference variable. In the latter case, changes are not reflected back in the calling method.

 
 
Operators

long l=123l;
int i= l;//CTE
int i=(int) l;// NO CTE

int a=5,b=10,c=30;
a=b=c;

We can use increment & decrement operators with variables but not with literal values. If we do, the code won't compile.

char ch='A';
SOP(ch+ch);//130



Operator			 	Data type
Arithmetic Operator		All primitive except boolean
++,--					All primitive except boolean and literals also
<,<=,>,>=				All primitive except boolean
==,!=					All primitive including boolean
&&,||,!


 byte b1=10;
    byte b2=10;
    //short sh=b1+b2;//CTE
    short sh2=(short)(b1+b2);//CTE
    
    final byte b3=10;
    final byte b4=10;
    short sh3=b3+b4;//CTE
    short sh4=(short)(b1+b2);//CTE
