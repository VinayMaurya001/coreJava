Introduction
For writing any Java Program, whether it is simple or complex, 
	the most commonly required classes and interfaces are grouped into a separate package, 
	which is nothing but java.lang package.
Without using java.lang package, we cann’t write any program in Java. 
	So it is implicitly imported in every java program. (import java.lang.*;)
	We may also write it explicitly.
