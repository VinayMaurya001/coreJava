Interface

Example:
JDBC API acts as requirement specification to develop database driver.
Sun people are responsible to develop JDBC API.
Database vendors(MySQL or Oracle) are responsible to implement this JDBC API.

Example:
Servlet API acts as requirement specification to develop web server.
Web server vendors are responsible to implement Servlet API.

Any service requirement specification (SRS) is considered as interface.	
Any contracts b/w client & service provider is considered as an interface.
From client point of view, an interface defines the set of services, what he is expecting.
From service provider point of view, an interface defines the set of services, what he is offering.

Example:
Through bank ATM GUI screen, bank people are highlighting the set of services, what they are offering. 
At the same time, same GUI screen represents the set of services, what customer is expecting. 
Hence this GUI screen acts as contract b/w customer and bank people.

Interface declaration & implementation
Whenever we are implementing an interface, for each and every method of that interface, 
    we have to provide implementation. Otherwise we have to declare class as abstract. 
	Then next level child class is responsible to provide implementation.
Every interface method is always public, whether we are declaring or not. 
	Hence whenever we are implementing an interface method, compulsory we should declare as public. 
	Otherwise we will get CTE.

Interface MyInterface
{
void m1();
void m2();
}

abstract class ServiceProvider implements MyInterface
{
public void m1()
{
}
}
class SubServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
public void m2()
{
}
}


Exetnds vs Implements
A class can extends only one class at a time.
class A extends B
{}
A class can can implements any number of interface simultaneously.
Class A implements M,N,O  
{}
A class can extends another class and can implements any number of interface simultaneously.
Class A extends B implements M,N,O  
{}

An interface can extends any number of interface simultaneously.
interface M extends N,O
{}

True/ False (Valid/invalid)
A class can extends any number of classes at a time.//invalid
A class can implements only one interface at a time.//invalid
An interface can extends only one interface at a time.//invalid
An interface can implements any number of interfaces simultaneously.//invalid
A class can extends another class or can implements an interface but both not simultaneously.//invalid
None of the above.//valid

X extends Y
1: Both X and Y should be classes//invalid
2: Both X and Y should be interfaces//invalid
3: Both X and Y can be either classes or interfaces//valid
4: No restriction.//invalid

X extends Y,Z
X,Y & Z should be interfaces

X implements Y,Z
X-class
Y,Z-interface

X extends Y implements Z
X,Y-class
Z-interface

X implements Y extends Z
CTE, because we have to take extends first followed by interface.


To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
	Diamond Problem

	
https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/the-evolving-nature-of-java-interfaces
As usual, the Java designers devised the following sensible and practical rules to deal with these problems:
Inheriting multiple abstract methods with the same name is not a problem—they are viewed as the same method.
Diamond inheritance of fields—one of the difficult problems—is avoided, because interfaces are not allowed to contain fields that are not constants.
Inheriting static methods and constants (which are also static by definition) is not a problem, because they are prefixed by the interface name when they are used, so their names do not clash.
Inheriting from different interfaces multiple default methods with the same signature and different implementations is a problem. But here Java chooses a much more pragmatic solution than some other languages: instead of defining a new language construct to deal with this, the compiler just reports an error. In other words, it’s your problem. Java just tells you, “Don’t do this.”
