Static control flow
Whenever we are executing a java class, the following sequence of activities/steps will be executed 
	as the part of static control flow.
	Whether main method present or not?
	Identification of static members from top to bottom (step 1 to step 6)
		i=0;(RIWO, read indirect write only)
		j=0;(RIWO, read indirect write only)
	Execution of static variable assignments and static block from top to bottom((step 7 to step 12)
		i=10;(R&W, read & write)
		j=20;(R&W, read & write)
	Execution of main method (step 13 to step 15)

Static members
	static variable
	static block
	static method

class Box{
static int i=10;//1,7
static//2
{
	m1();//8
	System.out.println("First static block");//10
}
public static void main(String[] args )//3
{
	m1();//13
	System.out.println("main() method");//15
}
public static void m1()//4
{
	System.out.println(j);//9,14
}
static//5
{
	System.out.println("Second static Block");//11
}
static int j=20;//6,12
}
Output:
0
First static block
Second static Block
20
main() method



Direct and indirect read of a variable
Inside a static block, if we are trying to read a variable, that read operation is called direct read.
If we are calling a method and within that method, if we are trying to read a variable, 
	that read operation is called indirect read.
class Test
{
static int i=10;
static
{
	m1();
	System.out.println(i);//direct read of i
}
public static void main(String[] args )//3
{
	System.out.println(i);////indirect read of i
}
}

Read Indirectly & Write Only (RIWO) state
If a variable is just identified by the JVM and original value not yet assigned, then variable is said to be in RIWO state.
If a variable is in RIWO state, then we cann't perform direct read but we can perform indirect read.
If we are trying to read directly, then we will get CTE, saying, Illegal forward reference.

Example 1
class Box
{
static int x=10;
static
{
	System.out.println(x);//RE, main method not found in class Box
}
}
Output:
Error: Main method not found in class Box, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application

Output for  before java version 1.7
	NoSuchMethodError


Example 2
class Box
{
static
{
	System.out.println(x);//CTE, Illegal forward reference
}
static int x=10;
}
Output://CTE
Box.java:5: error: illegal forward reference
System.out.println(x);
                   


Example 3:
class Box
{
static
{
	m1();
}
public static void m1()
{
	System.out.println(x);//RE
}
static int x=10;
}
Output:
Error: Main method not found in class Box, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application

Output for  before java version 1.7
	NoSuchMethodError
