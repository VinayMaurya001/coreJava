OOPs
	Diff b/w oop & oops
		OOP=ObjectOrientedProgramming
		OOPS = Object Oriented Programming System
	Class & Object
	Data Hiding
	Abstraction
	Encapsulation, Tightly Encapsulated class
	Coupling
	Cohesion
	IS-A relationship/INHERITANCE
	HAS-A relationship
	Method signature
	Method Overloading or compile time polymorphism or early binding or static binding
		Within same class
		Diff classes but in same class hierarchy
	Method Overriding or run time polymorphism
	Static control flow
	Instance control flow
	Constructors
	Type-casting

Relationship
	IS-A relationship
	Has-A relationship
	
Parent reference can be used to hold child object. But using that reference, we can not call child specific methods. 

Message Passing
3 pillars of oops
Advantage of OOPs

Class
	Members
		Fields
		Methods
	Static members
	non-static members
	static vs non-static members
	Type of Variables

Type-casting
	Primitive type casting
	Object type casting

Ways of creating Objects in Java
Design Pattern
	Singleton Class
	
Abstract class 
Abstract keyword
Abstract and concrete method
Abstract Class
	Cannot create object
	0 or more abstract method
Constructor, static & non static blocks may be present, Main() method in abstract class
Used using inheritance 
	Until complete implementation all child classes will be abstract.
Partial implementation
O to 100 % Abstraction achieved
Polymorphism achieved
Advantage
Disadvantage
When we used abstract class?
