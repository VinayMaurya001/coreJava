Lets suppose, I hav a kid in USA. Kid requested me to give a big ballon because his friend has one. At kid level our affection with kids very strong but not at young level(when we asked to our father , please give me Catrina Cafe).
I given promise
I goes to a mall or ship. 
Can ugive me bigeest balllon on ur shop. I did not even asked for price.
DTDC-Courier shop- What do u required? Please send this ballon to banglore. First he see me from top to bottom. Sir not possible.So I told him, as per as courierrules:
Money

Illegal 
Thing we cannot send.
So he told me we send out thing vis airoplane. Niddle pressed problem
It is not in transport supported form.
Now I gone one step down from ordering to requested form.
Can u guide me how can I send this to banglore.
He checked for small opener. He said we can send it to banglore after removing air.
We will fillup air in banglore.

Serialization:
The process of writing state of an object to a file is called Serialization. 
But strictly speaking it is the process of converting an object from java supported form to either file supported form or network supported form.
By using FileOutputStream and ObjectOutputStream classes we can achieve Serialization.
oos.writeObject(obj); -->FOS--> abc.ser


De-serialization:
The process of reading state of an object from a file is called De-serialization.
But strictly speaking it is the process of converting an object from either file or network supported form into java supported form.
By using FileInputStream and ObjectInputStream classes we can Achieve.
abc.ser -->FIS--> ois.readObject(obj);

Example:
import java.io.*;
class Dog implements Serializable{
	int i = 10;
	int j = 20;
}
class SerializeDemo{
	public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception{
		Dog d1 = new Dog();
		FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("abc.ser");
		ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
		oos.writeObject(d1);

		FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("abc.ser");
		ObjectOutputStream ois = new ObjectOutputStream(fis);
		Dog d2 = (Dog)ois.readObject();
		System.out.println(d2.i+"..........d2.j"+);//10..........20
	}
}
(d1)i=10; j=20; --Serialization--> i=10; j=20;
(d2)i=10; j=20; <--De-serialization-- i=10; j=20;


we can serialize only serializable objects.
An object is said to be serializable if and only if corresponding class implements serializable interface.
Serializable interface present in java.io package and it doesn't contain any methods. it is a marker interface.
If we are trying to serialize non serializable object then we will get runtime exception saying NotSerializableException.
