BufferedReader
We can use BufferedReader to read character data(text data) from the file.
The main advantage of BufferedReader over FileReader is we can read data Line by Line in addition to character by character
	, which is more convenient to the programmer.

Constructors
BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(Reader r);
BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(Reader r, int bufferSize);

Note: 
BufferedReader cannot communicate directly with the file. It can communicate via some Reader object.

Methods
int read();
int read(char[] ch);
void close();
String readLine();
	It attempts to read next line from the file & returns it, if it is available.
	If the next line is not available, then it will return null.

import  java.io.*;
class Test
{
public static void main(String[] args)throws IOException
{
		FileReader fr;
		BufferedReader br = null;
		try {
			fr = new FileReader("abc.txt");
			br = new BufferedReader(fr);
			String line = br.readLine();
			while (line != null) {
				System.out.println(line);
				line = br.readLine();
			}
		} catch (IOException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		} finally {
			try {
				br.close();
			} catch (IOException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
}

Note:
Whenever we are closing BufferedReader automatically underlying FileReader will be closed & we are not required to close explicitly.
The most enhanced Reader to read character data from the file is BufferedReader.
