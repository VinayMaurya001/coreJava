Usage of FileWriter & FileReader is not recommended because
While writing data by using FileWriter, we have to insert line separator manually, which is varied from system to system. 
	It is not convenient to the programmer.
While reading data by using FileReader, we have to read data character by character which is not convenient to the programmer.
	(like in case of searching mobile number in list of numbers).

BufferedWriter & BufferedReeader


BufferedWriter
We can use BufferedWriter to write text(character) data to the file.

Constructors
	BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(Writer w);
	BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(Writer w, int buffersize);
Note: BufferedWriter cann’t  communicate directly with the file. It can communicate via some Writer object only.

Which of the following are valid?
BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(“abc.txt”);//invalid
BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(new File(“abc.txt”));//invalid
BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(“abc.txt”));//valid
BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(“abc.txt”)));//valid


Method of BufferedWriter
1)write(int ch)
2)write(char[] ch)
3)write(String s)
4)flush()
5)close()
6)newline()//Extra available method




import  java.io.*;
class Test
{
public static void main(String[] args)throws IOException
{
FileWriter fw=new FileWriter("abc.txt");

BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(fw);

bw.write(100);
bw.newLine();
char[] ch1={'a','b','c','d'};
bw.write(ch1);
bw.newLine();
bw.write("Abhi");
bw.newLine();
bw.write("SoftwareSolutions");
bw.flush();
bw.close();

}
}
/*
d
abcd
Abhi
SoftwareSolutions
*/

Note:
Whenever we are closing BufferedWriter, automatically underlying FileWriter will be closed & we are not required to close explicitly.

Recommended
bw.close();

Not recommended
fw.close();

Not recommended
bw.close();
fw.close();
