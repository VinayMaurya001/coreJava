Need of customizer class loader
Default class loaders will load .class file only once even though we are using multiple times that class in our program.
After loading .class file, if it is modified outside then default class loader wonn’t load updated version of .class file
	(because .class file already available in method area).
We can resolve this problem by defining our own customized class loader.

Advantages:
The main advantage of Customized Class Loader is we can control class loading mechanism based on our requirement.

Example: 
	We can load .class file separately every time so that updated version is available to our program.

Default class loading
Student s1 = new Student();//load - Load Student class file
.
.(Student class modified)
.
Student s2 = new Student();//use
.
.
.
Student s3 = new Student();//use
.
.
.
Student sn = new Student();//use


Customized lass loading
Student s1 = new Student();//load - Load Student class file
.
.(Student class modified)
.
Student s2 = new Student();//Check whether Student class is modified or not, if it is modified, 
load specified class file. If it is not modified, use already loaded class file
.
.
.
Student s3 = new Student();//Check whether Student class is modified or not, if it is modified, 
load specified class file. If it is not modified, use already loaded class file
.
.
.
Student sn = new Student();//Check whether Student class is modified or not, if it is modified, 
load specified class file. If it is not modified, use already loaded class file



How to define customized class loader
We can define our own customized class loader by extending java.lang.ClassLoader class

Example:
	public class CustClassLoader extends ClassLoader{
		public class loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFound{
			//Check for updates & load updated .class file and returns corresponding class
		}
	}
	class Client{
		public static void main(String[] args){
			Dog d1 = new Dog();//Loaded by default class loader
			CustClassLoader cl = new CustClassLoader();
			cl.loadClass("Dog");//Loaded by customized class loader
			.
			.
			.
			cl.loadClass("Dog");//Loaded by customized class loader
			.
			.
			.
		}
	}


While developing web servers and application servers usually, we can go for customized class loader to customized class loading mechanism.

Q) What is the need/ use of ClassLoaderClass?
	We can use java.lang.ClassLoaderClass to define our own customized class loaders.
	Every class loader in Java should be child class of java.lang.ClassLoader
	Class either directly or indirectly. 
		Hence this class act as base class for all customized class loaders.
